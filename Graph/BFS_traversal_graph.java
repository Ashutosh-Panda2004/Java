/*
In both trees and graphs, BFS traversal explores nodes level by level, starting from the source (root in trees, starting node in graphs).

- In trees, BFS (level-order) visits all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level.

- In graphs, BFS explores all neighboring nodes of the current node before moving to the next level of neighbors.

In both cases, a queue is used to manage the nodes to be visited.
