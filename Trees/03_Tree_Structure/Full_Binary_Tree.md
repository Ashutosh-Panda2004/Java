The type of tree you're referring to is called a **Full Binary Tree** (also known as a **Proper Binary Tree**).

### Full Binary Tree:
- In a full binary tree, every **node** has either **0 or exactly 2 children**.
- This means no node has only one child. If a node has children, it must have exactly two.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Leaf nodes** (nodes with no children) are at the bottom of the tree.
- Every non-leaf node has exactly two children.
- It is different from a **complete binary tree**, where all levels must be filled except possibly the last one, and the last level must be filled from left to right.

### Example of a Full Binary Tree:
```
         1
       /   \
      2     3
     / \   / \
    4   5 6   7
```
- Here, each non-leaf node (1, 2, 3) has exactly two children.

### Differences from Other Trees:
- A **complete binary tree** allows the last level to be partially filled, but it doesnâ€™t require every node to have exactly two children.
- A **perfect binary tree** is a stricter case of a full binary tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level, and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two children. 

In summary, the "panditry" you're referring to is a **Full Binary Tree**, where every node has exactly two children or no children at all.
